# Wordle-Scheduling 

 C++ implementation of a worker scheduling algorithm for scheduling workers based on their availability and constraints, 
 utilizing recursive calls to explore different possibilities. 
 The code maintains a daily schedule and makes decisions based on the availability matrix, daily worker needs, and maximum shifts allowed.
 Second C++ program is an implementation of the Wordle game which takes a target word, floating letters, and a word dictionary and recursively explores possible word combinations, considering the positions of floating letters.
